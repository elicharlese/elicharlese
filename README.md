  <p><strong>My main focus is on web3 tech stacks, spatial science and containerization</strong> - React, Rust, Solana, Solidity, Redux, Typescript, Node.js and Next.js. However, I also have experience in Project Management, GIS analysis and Salesforce. University of California, Santa Barbara graduate with a degree in Geography (emphasis in GIS).</p>
