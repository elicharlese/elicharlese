# Elias Estrada
My main focus is on full-stack and blockchain development - React, React Native, Solidity, Node.js and Next.js. However, I also have experience in Project Management, GIS analysis and Salesforce - API's, Python, LWC and APEX. In addition, I graduated from the University of California, Santa Barbara with a degree in Geography (emphasis in GIS).
